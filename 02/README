HalfAdder.hdl - 
Chip,Computes the sum of two bits. 
input: 1-bit
output: 2- bit, sum and carry 

FullAdder.hdl - 
Chip, Computes the sum of three bits.
input: 3 -bit, three numbers
output: 2- bit, sum and carry 

Add16.hdl - 
Chip, Adds two 16-bit values
input: 32 -bit, two numbers of 16-bit each
output: the sum of the numbers (arithmetic addition)

Inc16.hdl - 
Chip, 16-bit incrementer
input: 16 -bit
output: in + 1 (arithmetic addition)

ALU.hdl - 
The ALU, Arithmetic Logic Unit, cumputes the function 
given in the input between two numbers.
input: 38 -bit,two numbers of 16-bit,
	6-bit then function we need operate, every bit represents 
other part of the function 
output: 18 - bit, 16- bit the result of the calculation,
	1- bit if the result came 0, 1-bit if the result is less then 1

ShiftLeft.hdl - 
Chip, 16-bit multiply by 2
input: 16 -bit
output: 2*in (arithmetic addition)

ShiftRight.hdl -
divide by 2 , preserves the sign and move on bit right
input: 16 -bit
output: in/2 (arithmetic addition)

Mul.hdl - compute multiplication of two numbers using ShiftLeft , Mux16 and Add16
